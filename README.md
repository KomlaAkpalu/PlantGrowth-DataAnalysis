# PlantGrowth Data Analysis with R

## Introduction
This project is an exploration and analysis of the `PlantGrowth` dataset using the R programming language. The primary focus is on understanding how different treatments affect plant growth, showcasing data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization skills.

## Objectives
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's structure and characteristics.
- Perform ANOVA to determine if there are significant differences in plant growth due to various treatments.
- Create visualizations using `ggplot2` to illustrate the findings.

## Dataset Description
The `PlantGrowth` dataset is a built-in dataset in R, containing data on plant growth under different treatment conditions. It includes:
- `weight`: The weight of the plant.
- `group`: The treatment group to which the plant belongs.

## Tools and Technologies
- **R**: For statistical computing and graphics.
- **ggplot2**: For creating advanced visualizations.
- Other R packages like `dplyr` and `tidyr` for data manipulation.

## Repository Structure
- `01_data_exploration.R`: Script for initial data exploration and analysis.
- `02_anova_analysis.R`: Script for performing ANOVA on the dataset.
- `03_data_visualization.R`: Script for creating visualizations with `ggplot2`.
- `04_summary_conclusions.md`: Summary of findings and conclusions.
- `05_session_info.R`: Script to output R session information for reproducibility.

## How to Use
To use this repository:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install R and the required packages.
3. Run the scripts in the order they are numbered.
